# notes-task

### Task 1: Build a simple React application that allows users to create, read, update and delete notes.
- Requirements:
    - [x] The user should be able to create a new note by filling out a form that includes a title and body.
    - [x] The user should be able to view all existing notes in a list format, displaying the title and a preview of the body.
    - [x] The user should be able to click on a note in the list to view its full content.
    - [x] The user should be able to edit the title and body of an existing note.
    - [x] The user should be able to delete a note.
    - [x] The application should be styled using CSS, with a clean and simple design.
    - [x] The application should be responsive and work well on desktop and mobile devices.
    - [x] The application should use React for building the user interface.
- Bonus:
    - [x] Implement search functionality to allow the user to search for specific notes based on their title or body content.
    - [x] Implement sorting functionality to allow the user to sort notes by title, date created or date modified.
    - [x] Please submit your code via GitHub or a similar code-sharing platform, along with instructions for running the application

### Task 2: Find and fix issues with the following code:

```bash
function multiplyByClosure(mult) {
    const values = [0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 'a', false];
    return values.map(function (value) {
        if (typeof value === 'number') {
            return value * mult
        }
        return value;
    });
}


function countZeroValues(values) {
    return values.filter(function (value) {
        return value == 0
    }).length
}


const multiplyByTwo = multiplyByClosure(2);
console.log(multiplyByTwo);


const multiplyByThree = multiplyByClosure(3);
console.log(multiplyByThree);


// count zero values, expecting 1:
console.log(countZeroValues(multiplyByTwo));


for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {


    const button = document.createElement('button');
    button.textContent = Multiply by ${ i };
    document.body.appendChild(button);


    button.onclick = function () {
        console.log(multiplyByClosure(i))
    };
}
```
We look forward to reviewing your work.
